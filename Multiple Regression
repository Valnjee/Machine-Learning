We can predict the CO2 emission of a car based on the size of the engine, but with multiple regression we can throw in more variables, 
like the weight of the car, to make the prediction more accurate.

#In Python we have modules that will do the work for us. Start by importing the Pandas module.
#Tip: It is common to name the list of independent values with a upper case X, and the list of dependent values with a lower case y.

import pandas
from sklearn import linear_model

df = pandas.read_csv("cars.csv")

X = df[['Weight', 'Volume']]
y = df['CO2']

regr = linear_model.LinearRegression()
regr.fit(X, y)

#predict the CO2 emission of a car where the weight is 2300kg, and the volume is 1300cm3:
predictedCO2 = regr.predict([[2300, 1300]])

print(predictedCO2)

Result is [107.2087328]

Coefficient
The coefficient is a factor that describes the relationship with an unknown variable.

Example: if x is a variable, then 2x is x two times. x is the unknown variable, and the number 2 is the coefficient.

In this case, we can ask for the coefficient value of weight against CO2, 
and for volume against CO2. The answer(s) we get tells us what would happen if we increase, 
or decrease, one of the independent values.

Example
Print the coefficient values of the regression object:

import pandas
from sklearn import linear_model

df = pandas.read_csv("cars.csv")

X = df[['Weight', 'Volume']]
y = df['CO2']

regr = linear_model.LinearRegression()
regr.fit(X, y)

print(regr.coef_)
Result:
[0.00755095 0.00780526]


Result Explained
The result array represents the coefficient values of weight and volume.

Weight: 0.00755095
Volume: 0.00780526

These values tell us that if the weight increase by 1kg, the CO2 emission increases by 0.00755095g.

And if the engine size (Volume) increases by 1 cm3, the CO2 emission increases by 0.00780526 g.

I think that is a fair guess, but let test it!

We have already predicted that if a car with a 1300cm3 engine weighs 2300kg, the CO2 emission will be approximately 107g.

What if we increase the weight with 1000kg?

Example
Copy the example from before, but change the weight from 2300 to 3300:

import pandas
from sklearn import linear_model

df = pandas.read_csv("cars.csv")

X = df[['Weight', 'Volume']]
y = df['CO2']

regr = linear_model.LinearRegression()
regr.fit(X, y)

predictedCO2 = regr.predict([[3300, 1300]])

print(predictedCO2)
Result:
[114.75968007]


We have predicted that a car with 1.3 liter engine, and a weight of 3300 kg, will release approximately 115 grams of CO2 for every kilometer it drives.

Which shows that the coefficient of 0.00755095 is correct:

107.2087328 + (1000 * 0.00755095) = 114.75968
